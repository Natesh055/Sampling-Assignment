### **Project Overview**

This project investigates how various sampling strategies influence the performance of machine learning models in classification tasks. The aim is to highlight the impact that different data sampling methods can have on model accuracy, especially when dealing with imbalanced datasets.

### **Key Concepts**

#### **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
To address class imbalance in the dataset, we employ **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), which generates synthetic samples for the underrepresented class.

#### **Sampling Strategies:**
We implement and evaluate five distinct sampling techniques to create balanced datasets:

1. **Simple Random Sampling:** Randomly selects a subset of data from the full dataset without considering class distribution.
2. **Stratified Sampling:** Samples data in such a way that the proportion of each class in the sample reflects the proportions in the original dataset.
3. **Systematic Sampling:** Selects every k-th instance from the dataset, ensuring evenly spaced selections.
4. **Cluster Sampling:** Divides the dataset into clusters (based on the 'Time' feature) and selects one or more clusters for sampling.
5. **Bootstrap Sampling:** Randomly selects data points with replacement to create a new dataset, allowing for repeated samples.

#### **Sample Size Calculation:**
The size of the samples generated by each sampling technique is determined using specific formulas, which account for the desired confidence level, margin of error, and the underlying variability of the dataset.

### **Machine Learning Models**

We assess the performance of several machine learning classifiers on the datasets created by each of the sampling methods. The classifiers evaluated are:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **XGBoost Classifier**
- **Gradient Boosting Classifier**

Each classifier is trained on the data generated by the sampling techniques, and the modelsâ€™ accuracy on test sets is compared to determine the most effective combination.

### **Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is a **credit card dataset** with the following characteristics:

- **Input Features:** Multiple independent variables that represent various attributes of the credit card transactions.
- **Target Variable:** A binary column called "Class," where the classes are imbalanced, making it an ideal candidate for testing different sampling techniques.

### **Sampling Techniques Implemented**

The project uses the following methods to generate balanced datasets:

- **Random Sampling:** A straightforward approach where a subset of data is randomly selected without considering class distribution.
- **Stratified Sampling:** Ensures that the proportion of each class in the sample mirrors the original class distribution in the full dataset.
- **Systematic Sampling:** Involves selecting every k-th data point from the dataset to form a sample.
- **Cluster Sampling:** The data is split into clusters based on a specific feature (here, 'Time'), and samples are drawn from selected clusters.
- **Bootstrap Sampling:** Resamples the dataset with replacement to create new datasets that may contain repeated instances of certain data points.

### **Results and Conclusion**

For each sampling technique, the accuracy of each machine learning model is calculated. The results are then compared to determine which combination of sampling technique and model achieves the highest accuracy. The best-performing sampling method and model are presented at the end of the analysis.
